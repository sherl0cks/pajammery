## Wanna hack?

### Required 
1. install git
2. install node.js (we're using stable 10.36 because that's what shipping on fedora and centos)
2. install npm
3. install a text editor of choice. I'm using atom at the moment. 
4. `git clone` this repository. 
5. run `node src\app.js` 
6. navigate to localhost:8080 to view the site in your browser

### Optional
1. install docker. this is used to package and deploy the app but you don't need it make simple changes to the site.
2. run `script/all.sh` from the root of the git repo. This will build and deploy the app as a docker container.
3. navigate to localhost:8080 to view the site in your browser
